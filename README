This is a companion project to the OpenImageIO source code 
(https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO).

AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO is for the source code to OpenImageIO.

AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO-images is a place to store (potentially
large) test images and the like that we don't feel belong in the main code
repo.
