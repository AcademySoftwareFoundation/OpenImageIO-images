This is a companion project to the OpenImageIO source code 
(https://github/OpenImageIO/oiio).

OpenImageIO/oiio is for the source code to OpenImageIO.

OpenImageIO/oiio-images is a place to store (potentially large) test
images and the like that we don't feel belong in the main code repo.

We're still working out the structure of how this repo should be laid
out.
